# Project Name: Enhancing Restaurant Performance on FoodieBay - Data-Driven Insights and Predictive Models

## Description

This repository contains the code and reports for a machine learning analysis conducted on the FoodieBay dataset. The analysis is divided into two parts: Part A focuses on technical aspects, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning model development, while Part B presents a consultancy report with business insights and recommendations.

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to provide an in-depth understanding of machine learning methods and Python skills, with a focus on applying digital literacy to research and develop a machine learning solution. Additionally, the project aims to address specific business questions posed by FoodsAnalytics, a data analytics consulting service specializing in restaurant reviews and food delivery platforms.

## Context/Scenario

FoodieBay, a multinational restaurant aggregator, has provided a subset of data to FoodsAnalytics, which seeks insights into factors influencing restaurant ratings. The analysis involves answering specific questions related to table booking, online ordering, average cost for two, customer review ranking, and other insights about restaurants, cities, and cuisines. Machine learning opportunities are explored for predicting restaurant ratings or categorizing similar restaurants.

## Datasets

- `FoodieBay.csv`: Contains the main dataset for analysis.
- `FoodieBay_metadata.csv`: Provides additional metadata.
